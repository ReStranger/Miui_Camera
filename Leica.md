## Why do you charge?
Applicable versions: `1720, 1800, 1970, 2030, 2120, 2370, 2460, 2510, 2540, 2700, 5.0`

We have spent a lot of time on this project. Usually a large version requires a lot of effort to find obfuscated code, and the labor and time spent on this process is huge.
In order to produce better quality camera work in the future, and to make our efforts more valuable, we have adopted a fee.
You may think that advanced settings and other features are not your work, so why do you charge for them? Because we spend about the same amount of labor and time to add this project as we do to find confusing code.
And we're the only ones doing it for now, so if you're willing to join our team and help out every time (with love, and almost weekly), then I'll consider making it all free.

## Notes on Leica cameras
Applicable versions: `4660, 4700, 4750, 4780, 4870, 0511, 0700, 0761, 0851, 0941, 1110, 1180, 1520, 1620, 1720, 1800, 1970, 2030, 2120, 2370, 2460, 2510, 2540, 2700, 5.0`

First of all, please watch the camera's completion project and some precautions: [Click here to enter](https://github.com/a406010503/Miui_Camera/blob/main/README_en.md)<p>
You choose to install the Leica camera of this project as if you have read all warnings on this project (including the following),
Installing this item may result in "boot loop" or "Camera Lost"
If you don't know what boot loop is and don't know how to save bricks, we strongly advise you not to use this mod!

By installing this module, you will be able to enjoy the exclusive Leica features of the Mi 12S series
Included: Leica Classic, Leica Vivid Photo Style options can be turned on! (The default photo mode is Leica Vivid)
And in the filter options you will be able to use four additional Leica effects (including: Leica Vivid, Leica Natural, Leica Monochrome, Leica Monochrome HC)
In addition, Leica's exclusive custom watermark can be activated!
As for whether the image quality of the photo has been improved, we will wait for you to experience it. The Leica algorithm is definitely there! <p>

Since this project is not officially allowed by Xiaomi, and the official is still trying to prevent the installation and distribution of models other than the 12S series<p>
I am not responsible for any equipment failures caused by the use of this camera project! (It is risky to play the machine, and you must be careful when you flash the machine) <p>
**This item is for academic use only, please remove it within 24 hours after use. **</p>

## About the problem of losing the Leica camera after flashing
As explained above, because Xiaomi is still trying to prevent the installation of Leica cameras, it is recommended that you install the camera in the Core Patch method first. <p>
You can unzip the camera APK in the package (located in system/priv-app/MiuiCamera.apk) and install it directly by cracking the core <p>
For example, the module Woobox software of Xposed has the function of Core Patch. It is installed using the "five functions fully open" of the core cracking. If you don't know what it means, it is not recommended for you to use it! <p>
At present, we also provide TWRP version for users who have failed to install it. It is not recommended to flash in without Root (because there may also be a Core Patch required), if you try to flash in and out of the problem, we will not be responsible for it! <p>
※Note: In order to avoid being restored after restarting after installation, please make sure that your camera version is lower than the corresponding Leica camera version. It is recommended that you flash the 3591 stable version first and then try the Core Patch installation! </p>
<p>
9/2 Update: Since version 4.5.000511.0, the Leica features and the public version of the camera have been merged into the same version, and this problem should no longer exist, but it is still recommended that you install the camera in the Core Patch method.

## What is Core Patch? How do I Core Patch?
A Core Patch is essentially a way to bypass signature checks, bypass version checks, and therefore install or downgrade unofficially provided system apps at will.<p>
Please refer to the following two Xposed modules for Core Patch, and make sure you have flashed the Lsposed framework before using them.
- [Core Patch](https://github.com/LSPosed/CorePatch/releases)
- [WooBox](https://github.com/Xposed-Modules-Repo/com.lt2333.simplicitytools)

## About the Leica Camera Completion Project
At present, we have tried to complete the functions mentioned in the project for Leica cameras.
It allows you to experience some functions that are "officially stated that the hardware does not support" on your model to be turned on.
The specific open function will be notified on the download page of the release!

## Is there any special difference between a Leica camera and a reference camera?

The biggest difference is that the Leica camera has built-in exclusive filter effects (Leica Vivid/Leica Classic), it is recommended to turn off your HDR function, the Leica taste will be more obvious!
The later version added the color grading developed by the color grading team of the Caika research group. The effect of the Leica camera will definitely be better than the public version camera. <p>
9/2 Update: Since version `4.5.000511.0`, Leica features and public cameras have been merged into the same version, and new versions will force Leica features to be enabled for all models in the future.
